## pictures

Pictures of Watchy screens hehe

## screen mockups

Photoshop files of different screens to aid in text positioning

Modified bootloaders (generated by menuconfig) to be faster. `...latest.bin` is the latest one generated and seems to be the fastest, though it isn't extensively tested

## share_calendar.gs

Google script to allow the calendar to be shared with the Watchy over a HTTPS query

## Watchy LUT.xlsx

Excel spreadheet of the Look Up Table (LUT) that is used to get the battery percentage from the voltage. Seems to be reasonably accurate.
